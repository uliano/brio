/*
 * parts/ch32v203g6.hpp
 *
 * The CH32V203G6 as a table of facts: 32 KB of flash, 10 KB of SRAM,
 * QFN28 with 24 bonded pins, and WCH's CH32V20x_D6 device class. The
 * rules this file obeys are parts/ch32v203c8.hpp's; read that one
 * first.
 *
 * TWO PORT BITS ON ONE PIN. This is a 28-pin package, and the datasheet
 * warns about the price (note 7): "for devices in 20-pin/28-pin
 * package, several pins are shorted (at least 2 I/O function pins are
 * physically shorted as one pin) ... the driver should not configure
 * the output function at the same time, otherwise the pins may be
 * damaged". Here one pin is shared, pin 19 = PA10 + PA11, and PA8 is
 * not bonded at all. The mask below says which port bits reach a pad;
 * it cannot say which of them share one, so a program that drives both
 * halves of a shorted pin is a hazard no constant here catches.
 *
 * BOOT0 SHARES PB8 (note 6): the two are sealed together, which is why
 * PB8 counts as bonded and why the vendor recommends a pull-down on it.
