Documents of record: RM0444 Rev 6 - SPI/I2S ch. 35 (35.4's table 205 is
the implementation table, 35.5 the SPI functional description with the
configuration, enable and disable procedures of 35.5.7..35.5.9, the
status and error flags of 35.5.10/35.5.11, NSS pulse mode 35.5.12, TI
mode 35.5.13, the CRC 35.5.14, the interrupts 35.6, the I2S 35.7 and
the registers 35.9), the DMAMUX request table 56 (ch. 11), the APB

The per-instance presence, APB register, vector, I2S capability, I2S
clock selector and DMAMUX facts come from `stm32g0/device_tables.hpp`.
Bench suite: `test_stm32_spi` (13 letters, 89 verdicts, on the
Nucleo-G0B1RE's self-link - [../bench.md](../bench.md)). Family fixture
`test/family_stm32g0/spi.cpp` plus fourteen negatives under
`tools/check_stm32g0.sh`.

## What the silicon does

Three instances of one block on the G0B1/G0C1 and two everywhere else,
each of which is an SPI **or** an I2S depending on one bit
(`I2SCFGR.I2SMOD`), with 32-bit transmit and receive FIFOs, 4-to-16-bit
frames, a hardware CRC and the enhanced NSSP and TI modes. Table 205 is
the roster and it has exactly two entries that move across the family:
**SPI3 exists only on the G0B1/G0C1, and SPI2 carries an I2S only
there** - one condition, so the reserve derives both from `SPI3_BASE`
and the device header's own `IS_I2S_ALL_INSTANCE` is the second opinion
the bench compares it against.

Five facts shape the driver.

**35.5.7 is a with-SPE-clear procedure, and the silicon does not enforce
it.** "Configuration of SPI" writes CR1 and CR2 with the peripheral
disabled; four fields say so in their own register description (CRCEN,
CRCL, FRF, NSSP, plus LDMA_TX/LDMA_RX), four more are gated by the
softer "should not be changed when communication is ongoing" (BR, MSTR,
LSBFIRST, CPOL/CPHA - and 35.5.6's Note hardens the last pair into "the
SPI must be disabled by resetting the SPE bit"). Measured on the bench:
**a raw write with SPE set lands on every one of the seventeen
configuration fields**, the four "only when disabled" ones included.
So the driver refuses all of them while enabled - one rule instead of
two, so no caller has to remember which sentence a field got - and that
refusal is the only thing standing between a program and a mid-transfer
reconfiguration.

**The disable is a PROCEDURE, and it is the only way this driver turns
the peripheral off.** 35.5.9: wait `FTLVL = 00`, wait `BSY = 0`, clear
SPE, read DR until `FRLVL = 00`. That makes ES0548 2.12.1's workaround
structural for the case it names, and the case it does not - a
receive-only master, whose clock stops only when SPE does - has its own
verb whose contract is the erratum's own advice (ignore BSY there).

**BSY is not a witness on the client side.** ES0548 2.12.2 says it may
sporadically stay high at the end of a slave transfer and names RXNE and
the NSS pin as the measures to use instead. Nothing on the client half of
this file waits on BSY, and every wait in the file is bounded and
reports rather than spinning.

**RXNE and not TXE drives the host pump.** TXE means "the transmit FIFO
has room", which is true well before a frame is on the wire and true
again immediately after; RXNE means "a frame has been shifted in", which
on a full-duplex bus is exactly "one frame moved, both ways" - and
reading DR is both the capture and the acknowledgement. One interrupt
per frame, and the transfer ends when the last frame has come BACK,
which is the only edge that means the wire is idle.

**The FIFO access width is part of the frame size.** Figure 363: with
DS <= 8 a frame is right-aligned in a byte and DR must be accessed a
byte at a time, or the silicon PACKS two frames into one 16-bit access;
with DS > 8 a frame is right-aligned in a half-word. FRXTH must agree
with the read width. Every read and write verb comes in both flavours
and `data(size, v)` picks for the caller.

## Types and verbs

`Spi<n>` - the resource. `regs()`, `irq()`, `bus_clock()`, `reset()`,
`dma_rx_request()` / `dma_tx_request()` / `data_address()` (the DMAMUX
pair and the address an engine is armed on), `i2s_kernel_clock()`,
`has_i2s_mode` (the reserve's constant) beside `has_i2s()` (the device
header's own macro at run time).

`enable()` and `disable()` are not a pair: the first is a store, the
second is 35.5.9's procedure and returns false when a bounded wait ran
out. `disable_receive_only()` is the chapter's other procedure and
`flush_rx()` its last step alone.

Configuration is `configure(SpiConfig)` - CR1, CR2 and CRCPR in three
stores - or the individual verbs `role`, `mode`, `clock`, `bit_order`,
`data_size`, `direction`, `nss`, `frame_format`, `crc`,
`crc_polynomial`, `dma_transmit`, `dma_receive`,
`last_dma_transmit_odd`, `last_dma_receive_odd`, each of which
**refuses while SPE is set and writes nothing**. Three verbs stay open
under a running SPI because they must: `software_select` (SSI - a
software client selects itself with it and a program stages a mode fault
with it), `crc_next` (35.9.1 has it written as the last data is), and
`rx_threshold` (35.5.9's note moves FRXTH mid-transfer to read the last
odd frame of a packed reception).

`SpiConfig` carries the whole option space and `spi_config_valid()`
refuses what the chapter forbids and no register checks: a CRC on a
frame size that is neither 8 nor 16 bits, an even polynomial, NSS pulse
mode with CPHA = 1 or in TI mode or on a client, hardware NSS output on
a client, and an LDMA bit without its DMA enable or with a frame wider
than a byte.

The vocabulary: `SpiMode` (mode0..mode3, bit 1 CPOL and bit 0 CPHA -
spelled the same way in all three targets), `SpiClock` (div2..div256,
the eight BR codes named by their DIVISION), `SpiDataSize` (bits4..
bits16), `SpiNss` (software / hardware_input / hardware_output /
hardware_pulse - a reading of SSM, SSI and SSOE that makes the four
legal arrangements nameable), `SpiDirection`, `SpiFrameFormat`,
`SpiCrcLength`, `SpiRxThreshold`, `SpiFlag`, `SpiInterrupt`.
`spi_rate_for(pclk_hz, max_sck_hz)` picks the fastest code at or below a
ceiling and REFUSES one the prescaler cannot reach.

`SpiHost<n, pins, TxEngine, RxEngine>` - the transfer engine
`util/spi_bus.hpp` drives. Its `Request` is the other two targets'
verbatim (cs and dc `PinRef`s, `cs_setup_us`, a command phase and a
full-duplex data phase with `Borrowed<..., Lease::reply>` loans, `len`,
`reply`, and the per-transaction bus configuration) with the rate as a
`SpiClock`, the mode as a `SpiMode` and the frame size as a
`SpiDataSize` defaulting to eight - so an 8-bit request looks exactly
like the other targets'. `init(clock, max_sck_hz = 0)`, `start(req)`
(true = completed inside start, false = the ISR posts `TransferDone`),
`isr()`, `dma_isr()`, `status()`, `prime()`, `bit_order()`,
`recover()`, `rebase(hz)`, `clock_for(hz)`, `sck_hz(code)`,
`release()`.

`LEN IS A FRAME COUNT.` With the default 8-bit frames a frame is a byte
and `len` is a byte count. With `bits` above eight a frame occupies TWO
bytes of the caller's buffer, low byte first, and `len` still counts
frames. Below eight bits a frame is still one byte, right-aligned, with
the unused top bits ignored on the way out and read back as zero.

`SpiClient<n, pins>` - the other end: `init(clock, Config)`,
`enable(first, second)` (SPE up with the first TWO answers already in
the FIFO), `write`, `poll`, `selected()` (a live read of the NSS PAD -
the peripheral publishes no such status bit), `drive_output` (the dark
listener), the error accessors, `isr()`, `disable()`, `release()`.

## How to use it

**A device on a bus, through the arbiter.** The chip select is a GPIO
the engine owns for the transaction's duration, exactly as on the other
two targets:

```cpp
constexpr brio::SpiPins bus_pins{
    .sck  = {'B', 3, brio::PinFunction::af0},   // SPI1_SCK  (DS13560 table 15)
    .miso = {'B', 4, brio::PinFunction::af0},   // SPI1_MISO
    .mosi = {'B', 5, brio::PinFunction::af0},   // SPI1_MOSI
    .nss  = {},                                 // software: the select is a GPIO
};
using Bus = brio::SpiHost<1, bus_pins>;
using Arb = brio::SpiBus<Bus, P, 4>;
using Cs  = brio::Pin<'A', 15>;

Cs::output(true);                 // deasserted
(void)Bus::init(clock, 8'000'000);   // 8 MHz ceiling for the whole bus

brio::post<Arb>(Bus::Request{
    .cs = Cs::ref(),
    .cmd = brio::lend<brio::Lease::reply>(cmd), .cmd_len = 2,
    .tx = {}, .rx = brio::lend<brio::Lease::reply>(rx), .len = 8,
    .reply = brio::reply_to<Device, brio::SpiDone>(),
    .clock = brio::SpiClock::div8, .mode = brio::SpiMode::mode0,
});

extern "C" void SPI1_IRQHandler() {
    if (Bus::isr()) { brio::post<Arb>(brio::TransferDone{Bus::status()}); }
}
```

**The data phase on DMA.** Name both engine slots and bind the channels'
vectors as well; the command phase stays on the frame pump and the
engines take the data phase at its end.

```cpp
using Tx = brio::DmaTxEngine<1, 1>;
using Rx = brio::DmaRxEngine<1, 2>;
using Bus = brio::SpiHost<1, bus_pins, Tx, Rx>;
brio::Dma<1>::bus_clock(true);     // the CONTROLLER is the app's
(void)Bus::init(clock);
extern "C" void DMA1_Channel1_IRQHandler()   { if (Bus::dma_isr()) { /* post */ } }
extern "C" void DMA1_Channel2_3_IRQHandler() { if (Bus::dma_isr()) { /* post */ } }
```

**A client that answers.** Load the first two answers before the host's
clock can arrive and write the next-plus-one on every received frame -
the pump runs ONE AHEAD:

```cpp
using Peer = brio::SpiClient<2, peer_pins>;
(void)Peer::init(clock, {.mode = brio::SpiMode::mode0});
Peer::rxne_interrupt(true);
Peer::enable(answers[0], answers[1]);

extern "C" void BRIO_STM32G0_SPI2_HANDLER() {
    if ((Peer::isr() & brio::SpiFlag::rxne) != 0u) {
        const auto in = Peer::poll();
        Peer::write(next_answer());
    }
}
```

**An I2S pair.** The kernel clock must be at least PCLK (35.7.4's
warning), which at 64 MHz means SYSCLK:

```cpp
(void)brio::Spi<1>::i2s_kernel_clock(brio::I2sClock::sysclk);
(void)brio::Spi<1>::i2s_configure({.mode = brio::I2sMode::master_transmit,
                                   .standard = brio::I2sStandard::philips,
                                   .divider = 21});
(void)brio::Spi<1>::i2s_enable();
brio::Spi<1>::data_halfword(sample);
...
(void)brio::Spi<1>::i2s_stop_transmit();   // TXE = 1 then BSY = 0, then I2SE down
```

`i2s_sampling_hz()` and `i2s_prescaler_for()` are 35.7.4's four formulas
and their inverse.

## Bench findings

Measured by `test_stm32_spi` on the Nucleo-G0B1RE's self-link (SPI1 host
to SPI2 client, four wires), 89 verdicts, three green `z` runs including
one from a cold flash.

**The block, and the reserve against the header.** SPI1 on line 25 and
SPI2/SPI3 sharing line 26; the DMAMUX pairs 16/17, 18/19, 66/67; the
reserve's I2S table and `IS_I2S_ALL_INSTANCE` agreeing on all three
instances. Every register comes out of an RCC reset at table 209's own
value (CR1 0, CR2 0x0700, SR 0x0002, CRCPR 0x0007, I2SCFGR 0, I2SPR
0x0002) - and **the reset CR2 is the one misaligned combination the
chapter warns about**: DS = 0111 (8-bit) with FRXTH CLEAR, i.e. a
byte frame size with a half-word read threshold, so a driver that
trusted the reset value would read DR at the wrong granularity.

**35.9.2's own sentence, measured: a "Not used" DS code is FORCED to
0111 and not ignored** - `DS = 0010` written, `DS = 0111` read back. The
register lies about what it holds, which is why the driver refuses the
code rather than trusting a readback.

**THE SILICON ENFORCES NONE OF THE CHAPTER'S CONFIGURATION RULE.** With
SPE set, a raw write lands on all seventeen of CPOL, CPHA, BR, MSTR,
LSBFIRST, CRCEN, CRCL, SSM, RXONLY, BIDIMODE, DS, FRXTH, FRF, NSSP,
SSOE, LDMATX and LDMARX - the four whose register description says "only
when the SPI is disabled" included. The driver's refusals are therefore
the only protection there is.

**A PAD THAT IS NOT AN ALTERNATE FUNCTION READS LOW AT THE PERIPHERAL'S
NSS INPUT.** Clearing SSM on a master whose NSS pin is an ordinary GPIO
output raises MODF instantly - the peripheral's NSS input does not see
the pad's level, it sees the (low) alternate-function input - and the
silicon then clears SPE and MSTR and BLOCKS THEIR RETURN until MODF is
cleared (35.5.11's last sentence). Found by a probe that meant to
measure something else. It is why the transfer engine's boot
configuration is `SpiNss::software` and why `SpiHost::init()` never
claims the NSS pad.

**The link.** Sixteen 8-bit frames byte-exact in both directions with
the host polled and the client one frame ahead on its own interrupt;
the same on the host's RXNE pump with exactly ONE completion; a
two-phase request arriving as one select window of three command frames
then eight data ones. All four CPOL/CPHA combinations and both bit
orders byte-exact, with a DORD mismatch producing an exact two-way bit
reversal as the control. **Every frame size from 4 to 16 bits crosses
exact in both directions** with a pattern that uses every bit, which is
also the proof of figure 363's access rule; the unused top bits of a
short frame come back ZERO (a 4-bit frame carrying 0xFF reads 0x0F at
both ends).

**THE RATE LADDER SAYS MORE ABOUT THE CPU THAN ABOUT THE WIRE.** Paced
by the engine's own polled pump - one frame written, waited for, read -
**all eight BR codes carry the link byte-exact in both directions, up to
PCLK/2 = 32 MHz**, because the gap between frames is the HOST's loop and
the client has all of it to answer in. Driven as a BURST instead, with
the transmit FIFO kept full, the measured frame period **floors at about
320 CPU cycles** (322 at PCLK/2 where the wire asks 16, 316 at PCLK/16
where it asks 128): a poll of TXE, a store, a poll of RXNE, a load, each
with its APB stall. **This core cannot make a continuous SPI clock out
of software**, so a CPU-driven ladder never presses the far end however
fast BR is set. The client's receive side is byte-exact at all eight
rungs with OVR never rising. What slips is the client's ANSWER, and it
slips NON-MONOTONICALLY (a faster rung passes above a slower one that
failed), which is a late interrupt and not a ceiling - so the
turnaround ceiling is declined there and measured in the DMA letter
instead.

**A POLLED BURST LOOP ERASES THE EVIDENCE OF ITS OWN OVERRUN.**
35.5.11's clear sequence is "a read of DR followed by a read of SR" -
exactly what a loop that reads the frame and then polls TXE/RXNE does,
every turn. When the burst does lose a frame (intermittently, at the
rung where the wire's frame period and the loop's are within a quarter
of each other) the host's OVR flag reads CLEAR afterwards and the only
witness left is that the frames do not add up.

**NSS, all four ways.** The client's hardware NSS input really is the
transaction: four frames clocked with NSS high reach it not at all, and
the next four with the select low all arrive. **Hardware NSS output is
literal in 35.5.5, read from the far end of the wire**: it falls when
SPE is SET - measured at 77 CPU cycles after the CR1 store, so a program
that read the level in the next instruction would read the old one -
stays low across every frame of a burst, and rises only when the
peripheral is disabled. It frames the peripheral's LIFETIME, not a
transaction. **NSS pulse mode frames a DATA FRAME**: eight frames raise
the far pad eight times, counted on EXTI line 12 - a pulse per frame,
which is what a latching slave wants and the opposite of what a device
driver's chip select needs. Between them they are the whole reason the
transfer engine's select is a GPIO.

**The CRC is the arithmetic.** Over six 8-bit frames with the reset
polynomial the host's TXCRCR is 0x5A and so is a bitwise software loop
over the same polynomial; the client's RXCRCR over the same six frames
is the same number; the other direction likewise, and the frame the host
reads back where the checksum belongs is the client's own TXCRCR. Also
0x5204 for a 16-bit CRC over 8-bit frames and 0xABD0 for 16-bit frames -
every one matching the software reference exactly. **The checksum frame
is the one NEITHER SIDE WRITES**: after CRCNEXT the shifter is fed from
the CRC register and a store there is one more DATA frame instead (the
trap the first version of the letter fell into, on both ends at once).
35.5.14's arithmetic confirmed: a 16-bit CRC over 8-bit frames costs
TWO extra frames on the wire, a matched pair costs one. CRCERR is staged
by giving the client a different polynomial - what can be corrupted on a
wire that carries exactly what was put on it is the RECEIVER'S
EXPECTATION - and 35.9.3's rc_w0 (a write of ZERO, not a W1C) clears it.

**TI mode** carries eight frames byte-exact in both directions with FRF
set at both ends, the polarity and phase forced by the protocol. FRE
staged by an 8-bit master against a 16-bit TI slave DID NOT REPRODUCE:
the slave resynchronized on the next pulse and the flag stayed clear.
Recorded, claimed neither way.

**ES0548 2.12.1 REPRODUCES.** A raw SPE clear with three frames in the
transmit FIFO leaves BSY standing; the same state disabled through
35.5.9's procedure leaves BSY low and both FIFOs empty. 2.12.2's own
subject did not reproduce in 32 rounds (BSY was never still high when
RXNE rose) - which proves nothing about a sporadic clock coincidence,
and the honest witness the erratum names, RXNE, rose on every one of the
32.

**The overrun is literal.** Six frames into a client nothing drains fill
a FOUR-frame RXFIFO and raise OVR, and "the newly received value does
not overwrite the previous one" means the FIFO keeps the FIRST four, not
the last four.

**The DMA engines, and the ceiling the CPU could not find.** Thirty-two
frames out and back byte-exact with no CPU between them and ONE
completion - the receive block's. The command-phase handover loses and
repeats nothing at the seam. A read-only request feeds 0xFF from a held
cell and a write-only one drains into a held sink (the two sibling verbs
`start_fixed()` and `start_discard()` this campaign added to
`stm32g0/dma.hpp`). **With BOTH ends on DMA channels the ladder is
monotone and has a real ceiling: byte-exact to PCLK/4 = 16 MHz, slipping
at PCLK/2 = 32 MHz** - a channel sustains frames an interrupt entry
cannot, which is the distinction the CPU-driven ladder could only name.
**35.9.2's LDMA_TX, measured**: three 16-bit DMA accesses to an 8-bit
frame size carry SIX frames with the bit clear and FIVE with it set, the
odd count told to the silicon being what stops the dummy half of the
last access reaching the wire.

**The kernel letter.** Four transactions queued from one dispatch come
back in order, every one `spi_ok`, with the bytes on the wire exactly
what each request lent; a request past the arbiter's pending depth is
answered `bus_rejected` immediately; an idle bus votes ok on a
`PrepareSleep` and a busy one votes against it; and **the per-bus
timeout answers a completion that never came with `spi_timeout` and
`recover()` puts the engine back** - the very next four transactions run
to `spi_ok` on the same bus AO. The staging is the honest one for a bus
whose host clocks itself: the ISR body runs and acknowledges the frames
but the `TransferDone` is never posted, which is the lost interrupt the
timeout was written for.

**I2S, on three of the same four wires.** I2S1 master transmitter to
I2S2 slave receiver, sixteen 16-bit samples value for value, with CHSIDE
alternating left/right frame by frame. 35.7.4's formula TIMED: I2SDIV 21
with ODD clear predicts 47619 Hz and the eight stereo frames really took
44172..45133 Hz of wall. **MCKOE is measured by what it does to the
rate**, not by a counter: the same divider with the master clock out
divides by 256 instead of 32, an eightfold drop (5952 Hz predicted, 5891
measured) - and the link still carries every sample with MCK sitting on
the MISO wire, PB4 being I2S1_MCK and PC2 I2S2_MCK, the pad pair this
self-link already has. The three STEREO standards - Philips,
MSB-justified, LSB-justified - each carry eight samples value-exact; all
three data lengths do in a 32-bit channel frame, with the 24-bit
length's second packet judged on the eight bits that are really on the
wire because the other eight are padding the receiver zeroes.
**35.7.8's UNDERRUN on silicon**: a slave transmitter whose data
register was never written raises UDR when the master's clock asks for a
sample it has not got - the one error SPI mode has no counterpart for -
**and the flag is gone by the next read**, 35.7.8's own clearing rule
being a trap with teeth: a poll loop that ASKS whether UDR is set is the
thing that clears it.

**The dynamic clock.** With a stated 1 MHz SCK ceiling the BR code is
re-resolved at every rung - PCLK/64 at 64 MHz, PCLK/16 at 16 MHz, PCLK/2
at 2 MHz, three different registers for one stated SCK - and the link is
byte-exact at every one, in both directions.

**Table 205's last row, on silicon**: an SPI interrupt returns a core
from a WFI in Sleep mode, eight rounds of eight and the FIRST wake in
all eight (the kernel tick being the other candidate, 1 ms against the
frame's 32 us).

## Not covered yet

**Driver gaps** - implemented nowhere, and a program that wants them
must reach the registers itself:

- **no half-duplex or receive-only TASK.** `SpiDirection` and its verbs
  are on the resource and `spi_config_valid()` knows the rules, but
  `SpiHost`'s Request is full-duplex only: a bidirectional device wants
  a direction turn in the middle of a transaction, which is a second
  Request shape and belongs with its first real user.
- **no DMA engine slots on `SpiClient`.** The samc21 left them for a
  device-shaped user and so does this; the bench drives the client's
  channels raw, which is what a peer does anyway.
- **the host's DMA path serves frame sizes of eight bits and below.**
  The engine slots carry `uint8_t`, so a request with `bits` above eight
  on an engined host runs on the frame pump. A second pair of half-word
  slots would double the task's template surface for a case the pump
  serves correctly; declined, and stated in the header.
- **packed 8-bit DMA is a RESOURCE fact and not the task's.** LDMA_TX
  and LDMA_RX are verbs and the rule is measured, but the task never
  packs: packing needs the caller's own buffer layout.
- **`SpiClient` has no address-recognition or wake feature** because
  this peripheral has none - the SAM's `FORM`/`ADDR` and its SSDE have
  no counterpart here. Table 205's "wake-up capability from Low-power
  Sleep" is the plain interrupt, measured.
- **the I2S receiver's shutdown sequence is the caller's.** 35.7.5 gives
  three sequences keyed by DATLEN, CHLEN and I2SSTD, each of them "wait
  for the (second to) last RXNE, then wait N I2S clock cycles using a
  software loop" - and how long an I2S clock cycle is depends on a
  prescaler the slave side does not own. `i2s_disable()` clears I2SE and
  says so; a driver that guessed would be stating a fact it cannot
  enforce.
- **no I2S task.** The chapter's own DMA note (35.7.9: "the DMA works in
  exactly the same way as it does in SPI mode") makes a streaming I2S a
  `util/block_stream.hpp` user, and that is born with its first real
  audio device.

**Implemented but not bench-verified** - the code is there and compiles
on every header of the pack, but no silicon has run it:

- **SPI3, on any board.** It exists only on the G0B1/G0C1 and its pads
  (PC10/PC11/PC12 at AF4) are not wired on this desk; the family fixture
  instantiates it, `spi_irq(3)` is checked against the header, and its
  DMAMUX pair is stated from table 56.
- **half-duplex (BIDIMODE) and receive-only (RXONLY) on the wire.** The
  register surface is refused and read back correctly by letter a; no
  letter clocks a transfer in either.
- **the I2S asynchronous start (ASTRTEN)** and the PCM long-frame
  synchronization: written and read back, never staged.
- **`SpiHost::prime()`** - the CPOL-flip-before-the-select verb. Its
  reason is the samc21 bench's measured one-bit slip; the same slip has
  not been staged here.
- **the second and third silicon.** Everything above is one G0B1RE.

**Declined, with the reason:**

- **the answer-turnaround ceiling of the ISR-driven client** (letter d):
  a ceiling needs a clock the CPU cannot gap and this core cannot make
  one, so what a CPU-driven ladder measures is its own loop. Measured
  where it can be - both ends on DMA, letter i.
- **the TI frame-format error** did not reproduce with the one staging a
  single board affords (a frame-size mismatch); printed, not claimed.
- **ES0548 2.12.2** is a sporadic coincidence of two clocks and 32
  rounds cannot disprove it; the honest witness it names is measured
  instead.
- **CRCERR by a corrupted word**: two peripherals joined by six
  centimetres of wire carry exactly what is put on them, so the
  receiver's EXPECTATION is what the letter corrupts (a different
  polynomial), said plainly rather than dressed up.
- **the I2S master clock's own frequency**: MCK is 256 x Fs (about 12
  MHz here) and no free pad on this desk carries a counter for it. Its
  effect on the sampling rate is measured instead, which is the same
  bit under a different question.
- **PCM's frame count**: with I2SSTD = 11 the WS line is a frame
  synchronization pulse and not a channel side, so the slave collects
  one sample fewer in the same window than the stereo standards do.
  Closing that would need a receiver that counts PCM frames rather than
  half-words; the count is printed and the samples that arrive are
  value-exact.
